      <br>I am from Cincinnati,OH and live at home with my family including, both parents, two younger sisters, and four cats. 
      <br>Some of my hobbies include playing music on various different instruments. I play the saxophone, clarinet, electric bass, and trumpet.
      <br>Saxophone and clarinet are my most comfortable instruments. I have played clarinet since high school, and played tenor sax since junior year of high school.
      <br> I started learning electric bass around the same time as the sax but didn't really improve until i started college. I don't play much trumpet but i have performed it during college.
      <br>I am also on the Wrestling team at Mount St. Joseph University. I have been wrestling for four years, having started my sophomore year in high school.
      <br> I am also involved in different band ensembles at MSJ. I am in Concert band, Jazz and pep band, and steel drum band.
